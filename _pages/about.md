I am a Research-based Master Student at the Physics & Computer Science Department at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/wilfrid-laurier-university) in Canada, Ontario, Waterloo. I am very fortunate to be a part of the EdgeSystems Lab under the supervision of [Professor Dariush Ebrahimi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VE7ROkQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. In particular, I am passionate about understanding the give-and-take between AI and Society, from mathematical and statistical principles. I genuinely adore applying Machine/Deep/Reinforcement Learning to societal challenges and learn from society to enhance AI.


My research interests are in the areas of **Computational Social Science** and **{Social} Reinforcement Learning**. My current work focuses on applying Reinforcement Learning to Transportation with considering Social Science factors.
